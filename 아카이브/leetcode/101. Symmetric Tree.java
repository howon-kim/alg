 *
 * Description
 * Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
 *
 * For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
 *
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   2
 *  / \ / \
 * 3  4 4  3
 *
 *
 * But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
 *
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   2
 *    \   \
 *    3    3
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
